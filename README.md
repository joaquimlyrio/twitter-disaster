# Disaster Prediction Based on Tweets

This project tackles the Kaggle competition "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started), where the goal is to classify if a tweet refers to a disaster or not.

There is one notebook for each type of feature extraction method, such as:
 - Universal Sentence Enconder; 
 - GloVe embeddings and; 
 - Tf-idf
 followed by different classification models.

All the code can be found under `/src`.
